# lichess_flowchart

Simple basic flask app that (when running on local host) allows users to select chapters from whatever public lichess study they want, and then build an opening flow-chart from the lesson. Nothing too fancy :) An example of the output can be seen below 


![Chapter_2](https://github.com/a-wille/lichess_flowchart/assets/55674109/77298ff1-b7b4-4c2f-9629-57e2282a67ec)

This is from a study I made for practice, but the script can and has handled much larger variation sets within chapters. Any feedback or bugs found are greatly appreciated :)
